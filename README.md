## 📝 Project Description

- We built an Alien Invasion Simulator that models a war between multiple army units across two opposing teams.

- Each unit type has unique fighting mechanics and targets specific enemy units under certain conditions, creating a dynamic battle simulation. The project emphasizes object-oriented programming principles and applies a variety of data structures to handle unit behavior and battle flow.



## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Language: C++

- Concepts: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Data Structures (Stack, Queue, Priority Queue, Deque)
